# Skill Documentation Generator

Automate the creation of standardized README files for skills by analyzing SKILL.md source files and enforcing consistency standards across documentation.

<Callout type="tip">
This skill is perfect for skill library maintainers who need to generate consistent, high-quality documentation across multiple skills automatically.
</Callout>

## Core Purpose

The Skill Documentation Generator serves three main functions:

1. **Automated README generation** from SKILL.md files
2. **Quality validation** enforcing documentation standards
3. **Batch processing** for entire skill libraries

## Three Core Capabilities

<Card title="1. Documentation Generation">

Creates comprehensive README files by extracting:
- Metadata and frontmatter
- Section content and structure
- Code examples and usage patterns
- Resources and references

All formatted according to standardized templates.

</Card>

<Card title="2. Validation Framework">

Performs multi-level quality checks:
- **Frontmatter** completeness and format
- **Description quality** (length, clarity, triggers)
- **Structure appropriateness** for skill complexity
- **Terminology consistency** across documentation
- **Resource validation** for links and references

Three severity levels: ERROR, WARNING, INFO

</Card>

<Card title="3. Batch Processing">

Documents multiple skills simultaneously with:
- Recursive directory discovery
- Parallel validation execution
- Automated index generation
- Consolidated reporting

</Card>

## Single Skill Workflow

<Callout type="info">

**Three-Step Process:**
1. **Analyze** - Extract content from SKILL.md
2. **Validate** - Check consistency and quality
3. **Generate** - Create standardized README

</Callout>

## Quality Standards Enforcement

The generator validates:

<Card title="Naming Conventions">

- Consistent file naming patterns
- Proper slug formatting
- Title capitalization rules

</Card>

<Card title="Description Requirements">

- Minimum/maximum length constraints
- Trigger word inclusion
- Clarity and specificity checks

</Card>

<Card title="Structure Guidelines">

- Required sections based on skill type
- Proper heading hierarchy
- Code example formatting
- Reference organization

</Card>

<Card title="Terminology Usage">

- Consistent term definitions
- Standard phrasing patterns
- Domain-appropriate language

</Card>

## Reference Materials

The framework includes:

- **Template definitions** for different skill types
- **Consistency rules** for terminology
- **Quality standards** for descriptions
- **Validation criteria** for all elements

## Flexible Options

<Callout type="info">

**Processing Modes:**
- Recursive vs. non-recursive directory scanning
- Optional validation (generate-only mode)
- Custom output directories
- Selective skill processing

</Callout>

## Integration Ready

Designed for seamless integration with:

- **CI/CD pipelines** for automated documentation updates
- **Pre-commit hooks** for quality enforcement
- **Batch library documentation** for skill collections
- **Version control workflows** tracking documentation changes

## Transparency Features

The generator emphasizes actionable feedback:

- Includes validation results in generated docs
- Provides specific improvement suggestions
- Shows before/after examples for fixes
- Explains reasoning behind each quality check

## Output Quality

Generated documentation includes:

1. **Standardized structure** across all skills
2. **Complete metadata** properly formatted
3. **Clear descriptions** with trigger keywords
4. **Organized sections** following templates
5. **Validated resources** with working links
6. **Quality badges** showing validation status

## Repository Resources

The repository includes documentation templates, validation rules, quality standards, batch processing scripts, and CI/CD integration examples.
