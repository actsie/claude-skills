# Learning Capture

A framework for recognizing and formalizing valuable patterns from work sessions into reusable skills with conservative, ROI-focused pattern recognition.

<Callout type="tip">
This skill is designed for skill developers and power users who want to systematically identify and capture reusable patterns from their work sessions.
</Callout>

## Skill Structure

The repository provides a comprehensive framework for pattern recognition and skill creation:

<Card>

**Main Files:**
- **SKILL.md** - Core learning capture framework and decision criteria

**Resource Directories:**
- **references/** - Supporting materials including:
  - `decision-examples.md` - Real-world examples of capture decisions
  - `skill-templates.md` - Templates for creating new skills

</Card>

## Core Purpose

The Learning Capture framework aims to recognize valuable patterns that will **save significant context window tokens through frequent reuse**, specifically targeting patterns that will be reused 10+ times and save 500+ tokens per reuse.

This systematic approach helps build a knowledge base of truly valuable patterns while avoiding noise from one-off or overly specific solutions.

## Five Recognition Triggers

The framework monitors for five types of learning moments:

<Card title="1. Novel Problem-Solving Approaches">

Creative, generalizable solutions to complex problems that extend beyond the specific instance and could apply to similar challenges.

</Card>

<Card title="2. Repeated Patterns">

Tasks requested 2-3 times with consistent structure emerging, indicating a pattern worth formalizing for future reuse.

</Card>

<Card title="3. Domain-Specific Knowledge">

Company processes and terminology accumulated across multiple conversations, representing institutional knowledge worth capturing.

</Card>

<Card title="4. Effective Reasoning Patterns">

Thinking structures that consistently produce superior results and could benefit other problem-solving scenarios.

</Card>

<Card title="5. Workflow Optimizations">

Efficient tool chains combining 3+ distinct steps that create a comprehensive, repeatable outcome.

</Card>

## Key Decision Criteria

Before offering pattern capture, **all three conditions** must be met:

<Callout type="warning">

**Required Criteria:**
- **High Confidence (>95%)**: Pattern will be reused 10+ times across future conversations
- **Strong Reusability Signals**: Clear evidence of pattern's ongoing value already present
- **No Redundancy**: Pattern doesn't overlap with existing captured capabilities

</Callout>

The framework explicitly warns against offering capture on:
- First instances of a pattern
- Highly context-specific solutions
- Ambiguous scenarios where reusability is unclear

## Conservative Approach

The guidance emphasizes being **"conservative by default"**:

> "Better to capture 80% of truly valuable patterns than create noise in the knowledge base."

This philosophy prioritizes quality over quantity, ensuring that captured patterns genuinely provide ROI through frequent reuse and significant token savings.

## Repository Resources

The repository includes detailed references and templates for:
- Decision-making examples showing when to capture vs. skip
- Skill templates for structuring captured patterns
- Best practices for pattern recognition and formalization
