# 🛠️ Claude Skills Library

A community-curated, auto-updating directory of **Claude Skills** — reusable SKILL.md prompt modules that make Claude smarter at specific tasks.

👉 **Live site:** https://abeezith.github.io/claude-skills/

---

## What is a Claude Skill?

A Claude Skill is a structured prompt module — a `SKILL.md` file — that tells Claude how to perform a specific task with precision and consistency. When Claude detects a matching intent in your message, it loads the skill and follows its instructions.

**Example:** When you say *"Create a Word document summarizing this report"*, Claude loads the `docx` skill and follows its detailed instructions for generating high-quality `.docx` files.

---

## How to Use a Skill

1. Browse the library at the live site above
2. Find a skill that matches your task
3. Click **"Copy Trigger"** to copy the example prompt
4. Paste it into Claude — and Claude will use the skill automatically if it's installed in your environment

> **Note:** Skills only activate when the SKILL.md file is accessible to your Claude instance (e.g. via a system prompt, operator config, or tool mount). Check with your Claude deployment for how skills are loaded.

---

## How to Submit Your Own Skill

1. Create a `SKILL.md` file using the format below
2. Push it to a public GitHub repo
3. [Open an Issue](../../issues/new?template=submit-skill.yml) with a link to your repo

Your skill will be picked up automatically during the next daily sync.

### SKILL.md Format

## How the Daily Sync Works

Every day at **2am UTC**, a GitHub Actions workflow runs automatically:

```
GitHub Actions (cron: 0 2 * * *)
       ↓
scripts/sync_skills.py runs
       ↓
Searches GitHub for:
  - filename:SKILL.md
  - filename:SKILL.md "Claude Skill"
  - topic:claude-skills
  - topic:claude-skill
  - "claude skills" in repo names/descriptions
       ↓
Parses SKILL.md front matter from each result
       ↓
Merges with existing curated skills (curated skills are never removed)
       ↓
Writes updated skills.json
       ↓
Commits skills.json back to this repo
       ↓
GitHub Pages serves the updated site
```

You can also trigger a sync manually from the **Actions** tab in GitHub.

---

## Run the Sync Locally

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install requests PyGithub python-dateutil

# Run with your GitHub token (higher rate limits)
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token_here python scripts/sync_skills.py
```

The script will update `skills.json` in place.
