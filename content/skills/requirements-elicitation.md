## Core Philosophy

### Conversational Discovery Over Assumption-Based Planning

Effective requirements elicitation relies on systematic discovery rather than assumption-driven specifications:

- **Active Listening**: Deep understanding through targeted questioning
- **Stakeholder Alignment**: Ensuring all perspectives are captured and reconciled
- **Iterative Refinement**: Continuous validation and improvement of requirements
- **Documentation Excellence**: Clear, actionable specifications that drive implementation

<Card title="Requirements Success Factors">

**Quality Indicators:**
- Clear, measurable acceptance criteria
- Stakeholder consensus on priorities
- Technical feasibility validation
- Comprehensive edge case coverage
- Actionable implementation guidance

**Common Failures:**
- Vague or ambiguous specifications
- Missing stakeholder perspectives
- Unrealistic technical expectations
- Incomplete functional coverage
- Poor requirement traceability

</Card>
