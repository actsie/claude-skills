# Skill Performance Profiler

A comprehensive analysis tool for optimizing skill usage by tracking token consumption, measuring invocation frequency, and identifying consolidation opportunities across conversations.

<Callout type="tip">
This skill is ideal for users who want to understand and optimize their skill usage patterns, reduce token waste, and improve overall efficiency.
</Callout>

## Core Purpose

The Skill Performance Profiler helps you:

- **Track token consumption** across all skills
- **Measure invocation frequency** to find heavily-used patterns
- **Identify consolidation opportunities** for related skills
- **Optimize resource usage** based on actual data
- **Make informed decisions** about skill management

## Three Key Capabilities

<Card title="1. Data Analysis & Metrics">

Gathers conversation history and processes it to extract:
- **Token consumption** per skill
- **Invocation counts** and frequency
- **Usage patterns** over time
- **Co-occurrence data** for skill pairs

Skills are categorized into four performance tiers:
- **Lightweight** - Under 500 tokens average
- **Medium** - 500-2,000 tokens
- **Heavy** - 2,000-5,000 tokens
- **Very Heavy** - Over 5,000 tokens

</Card>

<Card title="2. Usage Pattern Detection">

Identifies optimization opportunities:
- **Co-occurrence patterns** - Skills used together
- **Consolidation candidates** - Skills used together ≥50% of the time
- **Redundant invocations** - Overlapping functionality
- **Workflow sequences** - Common skill chains

</Card>

<Card title="3. Flexible Reporting">

Multiple output formats for different needs:
- **Inline summaries** - Quick answers to specific questions
- **Markdown reports** - Detailed analysis documents
- **CSV exports** - Spreadsheet-compatible data
- **Interactive visualizations** - Trend analysis and charts

</Card>

## Five-Step Analysis Workflow

<Callout type="info">

**Sequential Process:**
1. **Collect** - Gather conversation data via `recent_chats` tool
2. **Prepare** - Format data as JSON for analysis
3. **Execute** - Run analysis script on conversation history
4. **Generate** - Create formatted reports
5. **Present** - Deliver results in appropriate format

</Callout>

## Performance Tier Categories

Skills are automatically classified:

<Card title="Lightweight Skills (< 500 tokens)">

Efficient, low-overhead capabilities:
- Quick reference lookups
- Simple transformations
- Basic queries
- **Optimization**: Use freely

</Card>

<Card title="Medium Skills (500-2,000 tokens)">

Standard complexity operations:
- Moderate analysis tasks
- Standard workflows
- Common transformations
- **Optimization**: Monitor for consolidation

</Card>

<Card title="Heavy Skills (2,000-5,000 tokens)">

Complex, resource-intensive tasks:
- Deep analysis
- Multi-step workflows
- Comprehensive processing
- **Optimization**: Use strategically

</Card>

<Card title="Very Heavy Skills (> 5,000 tokens)">

Extremely resource-intensive operations:
- Massive data processing
- Complex multi-stage workflows
- Extensive analysis
- **Optimization**: Critical to optimize

</Card>

## Consolidation Detection

<Callout type="warning">

**Consolidation Candidates:**

Skills used together ≥50% of the time may benefit from merging:
- Reduces total token consumption
- Simplifies workflow management
- Improves consistency
- Streamlines invocation

The profiler identifies these patterns automatically.

</Callout>

## Report Formats

### Inline Summaries

Quick answers to questions like:
- "Which skill uses the most tokens?"
- "How often do I use skill X?"
- "What skills are typically used together?"

### Markdown Reports

Detailed analysis documents including:
- Executive summary
- Performance breakdown by skill
- Usage frequency charts
- Consolidation recommendations
- Trend analysis over time

### CSV Exports

Spreadsheet-compatible data for:
- Custom analysis
- Long-term tracking
- Integration with other tools
- Historical comparisons

### Interactive Visualizations

Dynamic charts showing:
- Token consumption trends
- Invocation frequency patterns
- Co-occurrence networks
- Performance distribution

## Important Limitation

<Callout type="info">

**Token Estimation:**

Token counts use a **4:1 character-to-token ratio** estimation.

This provides useful **relative comparisons** but doesn't reflect actual API tokenization precisely. Use for comparative analysis, not absolute measurements.

</Callout>

## Practical Applications

### Usage Optimization

- Identify token-heavy skills to optimize
- Find underutilized skills to remove
- Detect frequently-paired skills to consolidate

### Workflow Analysis

- Understand common skill sequences
- Optimize multi-skill workflows
- Identify bottlenecks

### Resource Planning

- Predict token consumption patterns
- Plan skill deployment strategies
- Budget context window usage

### Performance Tuning

- Track improvements over time
- Measure optimization impact
- Validate consolidation benefits

The repository includes analysis scripts, data collection tools, reporting templates, visualization generators, and consolidation detection algorithms.
