## What are Claude Code Skills?

Claude Code skills are reusable prompts that enable Claude Code to perform specialized tasks autonomously. Each skill is defined by a `SKILL.md` file containing:

- Detailed instructions for task execution
- Input/output specifications
- Style rules and algorithms
- Edge case handling

Skills help automate repetitive or complex workflows, making development more efficient and consistent across the PDS organization.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Claude Code CLI**: Install from [claude.ai/code](https://claude.ai/code) or via Homebrew:
  ```bash
  brew install claude
  ```
- **Claude Desktop**: Download from [claude.ai/download](https://claude.ai/download) (plugins work in projects mode)
- **For release notes upload**: [GitHub CLI (`gh`)](https://cli.github.com) installed and authenticated

### 🆕 Recommended: Plugin Marketplace (Easy Updates & Version Management)

The easiest way to install and manage PDS plugins with automatic updates and version control.

#### Option A: Public GitHub Repository

**Add the marketplace once:**
```bash
/plugin marketplace add NASA-PDS/pds-agent-skills
```

**Install individual plugins as needed:**
```bash
# List available plugins
/plugin list @pds-agent-skills

# Install GitHub workflow skills
/plugin install pds-github-skills@pds-agent-skills

# Install SonarCloud security skills
/plugin install sonarcloud-skills@pds-agent-skills

# Or install both
/plugin install pds-github-skills@pds-agent-skills sonarcloud-skills@pds-agent-skills
```

**Update to latest versions:**
```bash
/plugin marketplace update pds-agent-skills
/plugin update pds-github-skills@pds-agent-skills sonarcloud-skills@pds-agent-skills
```

#### Option B: Local/Internal Installation

For internal use, air-gapped environments, or testing before publishing:

**Clone the repository first:**
```bash
# Clone to a local directory
git clone https://github.com/NASA-PDS/pds-agent-skills.git ~/pds-plugins

# Or for internal use, clone from your internal git server
git clone https://git.your-org.com/pds/pds-agent-skills.git ~/pds-plugins
```

**Add the local marketplace:**
```bash
# Option 1: Use absolute path (recommended)
/plugin marketplace add /Users/yourname/pds-plugins

# Option 2: Add from parent directory
cd ~
/plugin marketplace add pds-plugins

# Option 3: Use tilde expansion
/plugin marketplace add ~/pds-plugins
```

**Important**: Run the `/plugin marketplace add` command from **outside** the marketplace directory, pointing to the directory that contains `.claude-plugin/`. Don't run it from inside the marketplace directory itself.

**Install plugins:**
```bash
# List available plugins (marketplace name will be auto-generated from path)
/plugin list @pds-plugins

# Install GitHub workflow skills
/plugin install pds-github-skills@pds-plugins

# Install SonarCloud security skills
/plugin install sonarcloud-skills@pds-plugins
```

**Update from local marketplace:**
```bash
# Pull latest changes first
cd ~/pds-plugins
git pull

# Then update the marketplace in Claude Code
/plugin marketplace update pds-plugins
/plugin update pds-github-skills@pds-plugins sonarcloud-skills@pds-plugins
```

#### Option C: Private Git Repository

For private organizational repositories:

```bash
# Add private repository with authentication
/plugin marketplace add https://git.your-org.com/pds/pds-agent-skills.git

# Or use SSH
/plugin marketplace add git@github.com:your-org/pds-agent-skills.git
```

Make sure you're authenticated with your git provider (e.g., `gh auth login` for GitHub).

**Benefits of Plugin Marketplace:**
- ✅ One command to add marketplace
- ✅ Automatic version management
- ✅ Easy updates with `/plugin marketplace update`
- ✅ Install only the plugins you need
- ✅ Works with public, private, or local repositories
- ✅ Official Anthropic plugin system

---

### Alternative: Manual Installation (Legacy)

For backwards compatibility or air-gapped environments, you can still manually install plugins.

#### Option 1: Project-Level Skills (Recommended for Teams)

Project-level skills are shared with your team via version control and automatically available when team members pull changes.

**Install for a specific project:**

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd your-project

# Create the skills directory
mkdir -p .claude/skills

# Clone this repository into the skills directory
git clone https://github.com/NASA-PDS/pds-agent-skills.git .claude/skills/pds

# Commit to version control
git add .claude/skills/pds
git commit -m "Add PDS Claude Code skills"
```

**Or add as a git submodule** (recommended for easier updates):

```bash
cd your-project
mkdir -p .claude/skills
git submodule add https://github.com/NASA-PDS/pds-agent-skills.git .claude/skills/pds
git commit -m "Add PDS Claude Code skills as submodule"
```

Team members can then pull the changes, and skills become immediately available:

```bash
git pull
git submodule update --init --recursive  # if using submodules
```

#### Option 2: Personal Skills (Available Across All Projects)

Personal skills are available in all your projects, stored in your home directory.

**Install globally:**

```bash
# Create personal skills directory
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills

# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/NASA-PDS/pds-agent-skills.git ~/.claude/skills/pds
```

**Update personal skills:**

```bash
cd ~/.claude/skills/pds
git pull
```

#### Option 3: Direct Git Reference

**Deprecated**: Use the plugin marketplace method instead. Direct git references are kept for backwards compatibility only.

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Failed to load marketplace" or "Invalid schema" Error

**Symptoms:**
```bash
/plugin install pds-github-skills@pds-agent-skills
⎿  Failed to load marketplace "claude-plugins-official" from source (github): Failed to parse
   marketplace file at .../claude-plugins-official/.claude-plugin/marketplace.json: Invalid schema
```

**Cause:** The official Claude plugins marketplace (`claude-plugins-official`) may have a corrupted or outdated schema that prevents plugin installation.

**Solution 1: Remove and re-add the official marketplace**

```bash
# Remove the corrupted marketplace
claude plugin marketplace remove claude-plugins-official

# Try to re-add it (if this fails, proceed to Solution 2)
claude plugin marketplace add anthropics/claude-plugins-official
```

**Solution 2: Install plugins without the official marketplace**

The PDS plugins can be installed independently without the official marketplace:

```bash
# Remove the corrupted marketplace
claude plugin marketplace remove claude-plugins-official

# Install PDS plugins directly
claude plugin install pds-github-skills@pds-agent-skills
claude plugin install sonarcloud-skills@pds-agent-skills
```

**Solution 3: Manually clean up the marketplace directory**

If the above solutions don't work:

```bash
# Remove the corrupted marketplace directory
rm -rf ~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/claude-plugins-official

# Update your PDS marketplace
claude plugin marketplace update pds-agent-skills

# Install PDS plugins
claude plugin install pds-github-skills@pds-agent-skills
claude plugin install sonarcloud-skills@pds-agent-skills
```

### Issue: Plugin Not Found

**Symptoms:**
```bash
/plugin install pds-github-skills@pds-agent-skills
Error: Plugin not found
```

**Solution:** Ensure the marketplace is added and updated:

```bash
# Add the marketplace if not already added
/plugin marketplace add NASA-PDS/pds-claude-skills

# Update the marketplace to fetch latest plugin catalog
/plugin marketplace update pds-agent-skills

# List available plugins to verify
/plugin list @pds-agent-skills

# Install the plugin
/plugin install pds-github-skills@pds-agent-skills
```

### Issue: Marketplace Name Mismatch

**Problem:** When adding from GitHub, the marketplace name is `pds-agent-skills` (derived from the repository name), not `pds-claude-skills`.

**Solution:** Always use `pds-agent-skills` as the marketplace identifier:

```bash
# Correct
/plugin install pds-github-skills@pds-agent-skills

# Incorrect (will fail)
/plugin install pds-github-skills@pds-claude-skills
```

### Verify Installation

To confirm plugins are installed correctly:

```bash
# Check installed plugins
/plugin list

# Should show both plugins with version 2.0.0 or higher
# ✓ pds-github-skills@pds-agent-skills (v2.0.0)
# ✓ sonarcloud-skills@pds-agent-skills (v2.0.0)

# View installation details
cat ~/.claude/plugins/installed_plugins.json
```

### Getting Help

If issues persist:
1. Check Claude Code version: `claude --version` (requires v1.0.0+)
2. Review Claude Code logs: `~/.claude/logs/`
3. Open an issue in this repository with error details
4. Contact PDS Engineering Node team

## Using Plugins

Once installed via the plugin marketplace, plugins are **automatically available** in Claude Code.

**How it works:**

1. **Install plugins** from the marketplace (see Installation above)
2. **Open Claude Code** in your project directory (CLI) or start a project in Claude Desktop
3. **Describe your task** naturally - Claude will autonomously use relevant plugins based on your request
4. **Provide necessary inputs** as described in each plugin's documentation

**Example:**

```bash
# Claude will automatically use the generating-release-notes skill
claude "Generate release notes for NASA-PDS/doi-service version v1.6.0"
```

**Managing Plugins:**

```bash
# List installed plugins
/plugin list

# List available plugins in marketplace
/plugin list @pds-agent-skills

# Update a specific plugin
/plugin update pds-github-skills@pds-agent-skills

# Uninstall a plugin
/plugin uninstall pds-github-skills@pds-agent-skills
```

See individual skill documentation (linked in table above) for detailed input specifications and examples.

**📚 For detailed installation scenarios** (local, private repos, air-gapped environments), see the [Plugin Marketplace Installation Guide](docs/PLUGIN_MARKETPLACE_GUIDE.md).
