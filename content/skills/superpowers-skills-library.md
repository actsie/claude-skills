Give Claude Code superpowers with a comprehensive skills library of proven techniques, patterns, and workflows for systematic software development.

## Overview

Superpowers is a revolutionary skills library that transforms how you work with Claude Code by providing systematic, test-driven approaches to common engineering tasks. Rather than ad-hoc solutions, it offers structured workflows that emphasize quality, testing, and complexity reduction.

## Core Philosophy

The Superpowers library is built on three foundational principles:

- **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests first, always
- **Systematic over ad-hoc**: Process over guessing  
- **Complexity reduction**: Simplicity as the primary goal

## Key Features

### ðŸš€ Slash Commands
Access powerful workflows instantly with intuitive commands:
- `/superpowers:brainstorm` - Structured brainstorming sessions
- `/superpowers:write-plan` - Create systematic development plans
- `/superpowers:test-driven` - TDD workflow guidance
- `/superpowers:debug-systematic` - Root cause analysis techniques

### ðŸŽ¯ Automatic Skill Activation
Skills automatically activate based on context, providing relevant guidance exactly when you need it without manual intervention.

## Installation & Setup

```bash
# Install via Claude Code plugin marketplace
claude-code install superpowers

# Verify installation
/superpowers:help

# Start with a brainstorming session
/superpowers:brainstorm
```

## Core Workflows

### Test-Driven Development Flow

The library emphasizes TDD as the primary development approach:

1. **Red**: Write a failing test that defines desired behavior
2. **Green**: Write minimal code to make the test pass
3. **Refactor**: Improve code while keeping tests green
4. **Repeat**: Continue with next feature/requirement

### Systematic Debugging Process

When issues arise, follow the structured debugging approach:

1. **Define the problem** clearly and specifically
2. **Gather evidence** systematically
3. **Form hypotheses** based on evidence
4. **Test hypotheses** methodically
5. **Implement solutions** with validation

### Complexity Reduction Techniques

- Break complex problems into smaller, manageable pieces
- Use evidence-based decision making
- Prioritize simplicity in all solutions
- Validate assumptions before proceeding
