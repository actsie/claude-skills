- Supporting evidence with citations
- Multiple perspectives

Output:
- Running reference list
- Refined outline based on findings
```

**Phase 3: Drafting**
```
Write:
- Introduction with improved hook
- Body sections incrementally
- Request feedback after each section

Output:
- Draft with inline citations
- Section-by-section notes
```

**Phase 4: Refinement**
```
Review:
- Comprehensive structure check
- Flow and transition analysis
- Citation verification

Output:
- Polished draft
- Final source list
```

**Phase 5: Publishing**
```
Finalize:
- Proofread mechanics
- Complete pre-publish checklist
- Prepare distribution

Output:
- Publication-ready content
```

## Usage Examples

**Start with outlining:**
```
Help me outline a technical article about React Server Components
for intermediate developers. Goal: 2000 words, focus on practical
examples and common pitfalls.
```

**Research phase:**
```
Find current performance benchmarks for React Server Components
vs traditional CSR. Add citations from official React docs and
credible tech blogs.
```

**Draft with feedback:**
```
I finished the introduction. Strengthen the opening hook and check
if it clearly communicates the value proposition.
```

**Final review:**
```
Full draft complete. Check overall flow, consistency, and verify
all technical claims have proper citations.
```

## Best Practices

<Callout type="info">

**For Research:**
- ✅ Verify source credibility before citing
- ✅ Prioritize recent, authoritative data
- ✅ Include multiple perspectives
- ✅ Maintain transparent attribution

**For Feedback:**
- ✅ Be specific: "Does this feel too technical?"
- ✅ Highlight concerns: "This section needs more evidence"
- ✅ Ask comparisons: "What's an alternative explanation?"

**For Voice Preservation:**
- ✅ Share writing samples upfront
- ✅ Specify desired tone (formal, conversational, technical)
- ✅ Flag misalignments: "This reads too academic"

## File Organization

**Recommended structure:**
```
~/writing/article-name/
├── outline.md          # Initial planning
├── research.md         # Sources and notes
├── draft-v1.md         # First draft
├── draft-v2.md         # Revised version
├── final.md            # Publication version
├── feedback.md         # Review notes
└── sources/            # Reference materials
```

## Citation Formats

**Inline Citations:**
```markdown
React Server Components reduce bundle size by 30% (Vercel Blog, 2024).
```

**Numbered References:**
```markdown
Performance benchmarks show significant improvements [1].

References:
[1] "React Server Components", Vercel Engineering Blog, 2024
```

**Footnote Style:**
```markdown
Early adoption shows promise¹.

¹ According to the official React RFC published March 2024
```

## Content Types Supported

**Technical Writing:**

## Section-by-Section Feedback

**Clarity Check:**
- Are technical concepts explained clearly?
- Do transitions flow logically?
- Is jargon appropriately introduced?

**Evidence Quality:**
- Are claims backed by credible sources?
- Do examples support main points?
- Are citations properly formatted?

**Style Consistency:**
- Does tone match target audience?

## About This Skill

<Callout type="info">
This skill was created by **ComposioHQ** as part of their collection of Claude Code productivity skills.

**Philosophy:** Writing is collaborative, not solitary. The best AI writing assistants enhance your voice rather than replacing it. They research, structure, and refine—but you remain the author.
