# Product Design & UX Review

A comprehensive skill for designing user-centered software products and conducting thorough design reviews using established UX frameworks and accessibility standards.

<Callout type="tip">
This skill is perfect for product teams, designers, and developers who want to ensure their interfaces follow industry best practices and accessibility standards.
</Callout>

## Skill Structure

The repository is organized to provide comprehensive design guidance and resources:

<Card>

**Main Files:**
- **SKILL.md** - Contains the main design framework and principles
- **README.md** - Overview documentation

**Resource Directories:**
- **references/** - Detailed reference materials including:
  - Usability heuristics deep-dive
  - UI patterns library
  - Accessibility guidelines
  - Design systems best practices
  - Interaction design guidance
- **examples/** - Sample designs and reviews
- **templates/** - Design review and component specification templates

</Card>

### Core Frameworks

The skill is built on six foundational areas:

1. **Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics** - Interaction design principles
2. **Design Process** - Research → Define → Design → Test → Iterate
3. **Visual Design Principles** - Typography, color, spacing, layout, iconography
4. **Interaction Design** - Navigation, feedback, forms, buttons, modals
5. **Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA)** - Contrast, keyboard navigation, screen readers
6. **Mobile-First Design** - Touch targets, responsive design, platform conventions

### How to Use

You can request assistance with:
- General design tasks ("Design a user dashboard")
- Focused reviews using specific frameworks
- Design creation for specific components
- Accessibility audits and compliance checks

The skill provides structured output including executive summaries, heuristics reviews, visual design analysis, accessibility audits, and prioritized recommendations organized by severity level.

## What This Skill Does

<Card title="Core Capabilities">

- **Design Reviews**: Evaluate interfaces against Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics
- **Accessibility Audits**: Check compliance with WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines
- **Design Systems**: Create and maintain consistent design systems
- **Visual Design Analysis**: Provide expert feedback on visual design choices
- **Interaction Design**: Guide users through effective interaction patterns
- **User-Centered Design**: Apply industry-standard UX principles from Nielsen Norman Group, Google Material Design, and Apple's Human Interface Guidelines

</Card>

## Example Use Cases

1. "Design a user dashboard for this app"
2. "Review this design using Nielsen's heuristics"
3. "Check this interface for WCAG 2.1 AA compliance"
4. "Create a design system for my product"
5. "Design an onboarding flow for new users"
6. "Analyze the visual hierarchy of this page"

## Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics

This skill evaluates designs against these foundational principles:

1. **Visibility of System Status** - Keep users informed about what's happening
2. **Match Between System and Real World** - Use familiar language and concepts
3. **User Control and Freedom** - Provide clear ways to undo and exit
4. **Consistency and Standards** - Follow platform conventions
5. **Error Prevention** - Design to prevent problems before they occur
6. **Recognition Rather Than Recall** - Minimize memory load
7. **Flexibility and Efficiency** - Support both novice and expert users
8. **Aesthetic and Minimalist Design** - Remove unnecessary elements
9. **Help Users Recognize and Recover from Errors** - Clear error messages with solutions
10. **Help and Documentation** - Provide searchable, contextual help

## Design Process Flow

The skill guides you through a complete design process:

**Research** → **Define** → **Design** → **Test** → **Iterate**

Each phase builds on user insights and data to create validated, user-centered solutions.

## Visual Design Principles

### Typography
- Clear hierarchy with appropriate font sizes
- Readable line heights and letter spacing
- Consistent font families across the interface

### Color Systems
- Accessible color contrast (4.5:1 for text)
- Meaningful color usage
- Support for color-blind users

### Spacing & Layout
- 8-point grid system for consistency
- Responsive layouts that adapt to screen sizes
- Proper whitespace for visual breathing room

### Iconography
- Consistent icon style and size
- Clear, recognizable symbols
- Proper labeling for accessibility

## Accessibility Standards (WCAG 2.1 AA)

<Callout type="info">
Accessibility isn't optional—it's essential for reaching all users and often required by law.
</Callout>

This skill ensures compliance with:

- **4.5:1 contrast ratio** for normal text
- **Complete keyboard navigation** for all interactive elements
- **Screen reader compatibility** with proper ARIA labels
- **Visible focus indicators** for keyboard users
- **Meaningful alternative text** for images and icons

## Mobile-First Design

- **Touch targets**: Minimum 44×44px for easy tapping
- **Responsive design**: Progressive enhancement from mobile to desktop
- **Platform conventions**: iOS and Android specific patterns
- **Performance**: Optimized loading and interactions
- **Gesture support**: Natural mobile interactions

## Common Design Patterns

### Navigation
- Top navigation bars
- Side navigation drawers
- Bottom navigation
- Tab navigation
- Breadcrumb trails

### Forms
- Single-column layouts
- Inline validation
- Clear error messages
- Progress indicators
- Smart defaults

### Feedback & Notifications
- Toast messages
- Modal dialogs
- Inline alerts
- Loading states
- Empty states

## Design Review Methodology

When you request a design review, you'll receive:

1. **Executive Summary**
   - Critical issues identified
   - Key improvement opportunities
   - Overall assessment

2. **Heuristics Assessment**
   - Evaluation against all 10 heuristics
   - Pass/Fail/Needs Improvement status for each
   - Specific examples and recommendations

3. **Visual Design Analysis**
   - Typography review
   - Color system evaluation
   - Spacing and layout assessment
   - Visual hierarchy analysis

4. **Accessibility Audit**
   - WCAG 2.1 AA compliance check
   - Keyboard navigation testing
   - Screen reader compatibility
   - Color contrast verification

5. **Interaction Design Review**
   - User flow analysis
   - Interaction pattern evaluation
   - Feedback mechanism assessment

6. **Prioritized Recommendations**
   - **Critical**: Must fix immediately
   - **High**: Important for user experience
   - **Medium**: Noticeable improvements
   - **Low**: Nice-to-have enhancements

## Frameworks & Standards

- Nielsen Norman Group's Usability Heuristics
- Google Material Design
- Apple Human Interface Guidelines
- WCAG 2.1 AA Accessibility Standards
