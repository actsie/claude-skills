## The Problem: Information Overload

Have you ever looked at your **YouTube "Watch Later"** or **Bilibili "Favorites"** list and felt anxiety?

You've saved thousands of high-quality tutorials, lectures, and talks, thinking "I'll learn this later." But "later" never comes because watching video is time-consuming.

**Video-Skill-Transcriber** is the solution. It autonomously batches download and transcribes your backlog, converting hours of video into structured text that AI can digest in seconds.

**Turn "Watch Later" into "Knowledge Acquired".**

| **Multi-Engine ASR** | Whisper (Local), Qwen3 (Chinese Optimized), OpenAI API | Offline & Online support |
| **API Server** | FastAPI interface for remote calls | **New** |
| **Batch Pipeline** | Auto-fetch "Watch Later" -> Download -> Transcribe | **Core Feature** |

## Installation

### Method 1: Standalone Usage (Recommended)

1.  **Clone or Download ZIP**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/JackMeds/Video-Skill-Transcriber.git
    # Or download ZIP from Release page
    cd Video-Skill-Transcriber
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(Requires [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) installed)*

3.  **Update**:
    Run the self-update tool (works for both Git and ZIP installs):
    ```bash
    python -m tools.update_skill
    ```

### Method 2: Install to Agent (e.g., OpenClaw)

To integrate this skill into an existing Agent environment:
```bash
python install.py --target /path/to/.agent/skills
```
This creates a symlink, ensuring your Agent always uses the latest code.

3.  **(Optional) Configure API**:
    Copy `.env.example` to `.env` if you want to use Online Transcription.

## Usage

### 1. General Download
```bash
python -m tools.download "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ"
```

### 2. Transcribe / Video Understanding
```bash
# Local Whisper (Default)
python -m tools.transcribe "output/video.m4a"

# Local Qwen3-ASR (Best for Chinese)
python -m tools.transcribe "output/video.m4a" -m Qwen/Qwen3-ASR-0.6B

# Multimodal AI (Gemini 1.5) - Reads video directly
python -m tools.transcribe "output/video.mp4" -m gemini

# Online API (Fastest)
python -m tools.transcribe "output/video.m4a" -m openai
```

### 3. Start API Server
Allow remote Agents to use these tools via HTTP:
```bash
python -m tools.api_server
# Docs: http://localhost:8000/docs
```

## Bilibili Workflow

We support both **Public** and **Authenticated** modes.

### Mode 1: Public Access (Default)
For standard public videos, **no login is required**. Just use the download tool directly.

```bash
python -m tools.download "https://www.bilibili.com/video/BVxxx"
```

### Mode 2: Authenticated (Advanced)
Login is required ONLY if you want to:
1. Access your private **"Watch Later"** or **"Favorites"** lists.
2. Download **1080P+ / Premium** quality videos.

**Steps:**

1.  **Login via QR Code**:
    ```bash
    python -m tools.auth
    ```
    *(Session is saved locally to `.user_session.json`)*

2.  **Process Backlog**:
    Once logged in, you can fetch your private lists:
    ```bash
    # 1. Fetch Top 10 from Watch Later
    python -m tools.list --watch-later --limit 10

    # 2. Run the pipeline
    python -m tools.batch_run
    ```

## For AI Agents (Skills)

Give [`skills/VIDEO_SKILL.md`](skills/VIDEO_SKILL.md) to your AI Agent (Claude/ChatGPT). It will learn to use these tools autonomously.
