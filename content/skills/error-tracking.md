# Error Tracking with Sentry

Standardized patterns for integrating Sentry v8 error tracking and performance monitoring across all project services, with mandatory error reporting, proper context capture, severity classification, and workflow instrumentation.

<Callout type="tip">
Essential for production applications requiring comprehensive error tracking and performance monitoring with Sentry.
</Callout>

## Core Purpose

This skill provides complete Sentry integration patterns for:

- **Error Capture**: Comprehensive error tracking across services
- **Context Enrichment**: Capture relevant error context and metadata
- **Severity Levels**: Proper error classification and prioritization
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track application performance metrics
- **Workflow Instrumentation**: Monitor critical business flows
- **Production Reliability**: Ensure no errors go unnoticed

## Key Features
