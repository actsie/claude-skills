# Token Budget Advisor

An early assessment tool that detects token-intensive tasks and provides specific chunking strategies to prevent exceeding context window constraints before work begins.

<Callout type="tip">
This skill is ideal for users planning complex, multi-document tasks who want to avoid hitting token limits mid-stream and need strategic guidance on task breakdown.
</Callout>

## Core Purpose

The Token Budget Advisor helps you:

- **Detect token-heavy tasks** before you start working
- **Plan chunking strategies** tailored to your specific task
- **Avoid context overruns** by working strategically
- **Maintain momentum** through structured task breakdown

## Early Warning System

The advisor identifies token-intensive scenarios:

<Card title="High-Risk Task Indicators">

Triggers that signal potential token issues:
- **Multiple file uploads** (3+ documents)
- **"Comprehensive" analysis** requests
- **10+ tool calls** required for completion
- **Large-scale processing** across many items
- **Deep multi-stage workflows** with extensive outputs

</Card>

## Token Estimation Framework

<Callout type="info">

**Rough Consumption Guidelines:**

- **Uploaded documents**: 1,000–5,000 tokens each
- **Web fetches**: 2,000–8,000 tokens per fetch
- **Long-form reports**: 5,000–15,000 tokens
- **Tool call overhead**: 1,000–3,000 tokens average per call
- **Code file analysis**: 500–3,000 tokens per file

These are estimates for planning purposes.

</Callout>

## Warning Thresholds

Budget warnings trigger at different consumption levels:

- **60-80%** - Caution: Monitor token usage
- **80-90%** - Warning: Consider chunking
- **90-95%** - High risk: Chunking recommended
- **95%+** - Critical: Chunking required

## Five Chunking Strategies

<Card title="1. Sequential Processing">

Time-ordered or phase-based analysis:
- Process data by time periods (quarterly, monthly)
- Handle project phases separately
- Work through stages chronologically
- Complete one period before moving to next

**Best for**: Historical data, timeline analysis, phased projects

</Card>

<Card title="2. Dimensional Breakdown">

Multi-faceted topic separation:
- Analyze different aspects independently
- Separate concerns (financial, competitive, regulatory)
- Focus on one dimension at a time
- Synthesize findings across dimensions

**Best for**: Complex topics with distinct aspects, multi-angle analysis

</Card>

<Card title="3. Depth Progression">

Iterative refinement cycles:
- **Cycle 1**: Create outline or high-level structure
- **Cycle 2**: Develop draft content
- **Cycle 3**: Refine and polish details
- **Cycle 4**: Final review and completion

**Best for**: Long-form content, reports, documentation

</Card>

<Card title="4. Subset Sampling">

Representative analysis across large sets:
- Select representative samples
- Analyze subset thoroughly
- Identify patterns and themes
- Generalize findings to full set
- Validate with additional samples if needed

**Best for**: Large document collections, bulk data analysis

</Card>

<Card title="5. Parallel Track Processing">

Independent workstream separation:
- Identify independent components
- Process tracks separately
- Maintain isolation between tracks
- Combine results at the end
- Cross-reference for consistency

**Best for**: Multi-component projects, parallel workflows

</Card>

## Strategic Planning Approach

<Callout type="warning">

**Prevention Over Recovery:**

The advisor intervenes **before** you start work, not after hitting limits. This prevents:
- Lost progress from truncated conversations
- Incomplete analysis from mid-task limits
- Frustration from unexpected stops
- Wasted tokens on aborted attempts

</Callout>

## Communication Style

The advisor takes a solution-oriented approach:

- **Matter-of-fact** rather than apologetic
- **Frames chunking positively** as improving thoroughness
- **Maintains user control** over strategy selection
- **Keeps momentum** toward task completion
- **Actionable recommendations** not just warnings

## Chunking Benefits

Strategic task breakdown offers advantages beyond token management:

<Card title="Improved Quality">

- Deeper focus on each chunk
- More thorough analysis per section
- Better attention to detail
- Reduced cognitive overload

</Card>

<Card title="Better Organization">

- Clear task structure
- Logical progression
- Easier to track progress
- Natural checkpoints

</Card>

<Card title="Flexibility">

- Adjust strategy mid-course if needed
- Reprioritize based on findings
- Pause and resume easily
- Iterate on specific sections

</Card>

<Card title="Maintained Context">

- Keep relevant information available
- Avoid truncating important details
- Preserve conversation continuity
- Complete thoughts and analysis

</Card>

## Practical Recommendations

The advisor provides specific guidance:

- **Chunk size suggestions** based on task complexity
- **Processing order** optimized for dependencies
- **Checkpoint placement** for natural breaks
- **Synthesis strategies** for combining chunks
- **Fallback plans** if initial approach doesn't work

## Task Assessment Process

<Callout type="info">

**Three-Step Evaluation:**

1. **Estimate total token requirements**
   - Count inputs (files, fetches)
   - Estimate processing overhead
   - Project output size

2. **Compare against available budget**
   - Calculate percentage utilization
   - Identify warning threshold
   - Determine if chunking needed

3. **Recommend specific strategy**
   - Select appropriate chunking approach
   - Provide actionable plan
   - Outline execution steps

</Callout>

## When the Advisor Activates

The advisor triggers for requests involving:

- Analysis of multiple large documents
- Comprehensive reports or deliverables
- Multi-stage complex workflows
- Large-scale data processing
- Tasks with "thorough" or "comprehensive" modifiers

## Integration with Workflow

The advisor works seamlessly:

- **Early intervention** before starting work
- **Quick assessment** doesn't delay task
- **Clear recommendations** easy to follow
- **Optional guidance** you choose the approach
- **Maintains momentum** toward completion
