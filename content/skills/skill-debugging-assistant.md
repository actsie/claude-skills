# Skill Debugging Assistant

A comprehensive diagnostic framework for troubleshooting skill issues by systematically analyzing triggers, parameters, prompts, and structural problems.

<Callout type="tip">
This skill is essential for skill developers who need to diagnose why skills aren't triggering correctly, producing unexpected behavior, or failing validation.
</Callout>

## Skill Structure

The repository provides complete diagnostic tools and reference materials:

<Card>

**Main Files:**
- **SKILL.md** - Core diagnostic framework and decision trees

**Resource Directories:**
- **references/** - Detailed troubleshooting guides and templates
- **scripts/** - Automated validation and checking tools

</Card>

## Core Purpose

The Skill Debugging Assistant helps diagnose and fix four main categories of skill issues:

1. **Skills failing to activate** when expected
2. **Incorrect or false-positive triggers** firing at wrong times
3. **Unexpected behavior** despite proper triggering
4. **Validation and packaging errors** preventing deployment

## Diagnostic Approach

<Card title="Decision Tree Workflow">

The framework uses a systematic decision tree starting with problem identification, then moves through specialized diagnostics:

1. **Problem Identification** - Categorize the specific issue type
2. **Trigger Failure Analysis** - Examine description quality and specificity
3. **False Positive Diagnostics** - Review over-broad or ambiguous descriptions
4. **Instruction Conflict Detection** - Find contradictory statements
5. **Structure Validation** - Run automated checks and manual reviews

</Card>

## Description Analysis

A key focus is improving skill descriptions to compete effectively among 100+ available skills:

<Callout type="warning">

**Critical Description Elements:**
- **Specific trigger terms** - File types, task names, domains
- **Use-case scenarios** - When and how to use the skill
- **Differentiating details** - What makes this skill unique

</Callout>

### Common Description Problems

- Missing concrete trigger indicators
- Overly broad or generic language
- Lack of differentiation from similar skills
- Buried critical information in references instead of main description

## Key Recommendations

<Card title="Trigger Optimization">

**Add Concrete Indicators:**
- File types (`.tsx`, `.py`, `.md`)
- Task names ("code review", "data analysis")
- Domain terms ("authentication", "deployment")

**Replace Absolute Statements:**
- Change "always/never" to conditional phrasing
- Use "typically", "when", "if" for nuanced triggers

</Card>

<Card title="Structure Guidelines">

**Keep SKILL.md Focused:**
- Under 500 lines for optimal performance
- Move detailed content to `references/` directory
- Ensure critical instructions stay in SKILL.md
- Don't bury essential information in external files

</Card>

## Validation Tools

The repository includes:

- **Python validation scripts** for automated checking
- **YAML formatting validators**
- **Naming convention checkers**
- **Structural requirement analyzers**

These tools catch common errors before they cause runtime issues.

## Systematic Troubleshooting

The framework provides:

- **Quality checklists** for pre-deployment review
- **Deep-analysis templates** for complex issues
- **Before/after examples** showing effective fixes
- **Common pitfall catalog** with solutions

## Problem Categories Deep Dive

### 1. Trigger Failures

When skills don't activate:
- Description too generic or vague
- Missing key terminology users would employ
- Insufficient differentiation from other skills
- Trigger words not matching user intent

### 2. False Positives

When skills fire incorrectly:
- Over-broad descriptions
- Ambiguous trigger conditions
- Lack of exclusion criteria
- Poor scoping of responsibilities

### 3. Behavior Issues

When triggered skills behave unexpectedly:
- Conflicting instructions within SKILL.md
- Contradictory guidance in references
- Unclear precedence rules
- Missing edge case handling

### 4. Validation Errors

Packaging and deployment problems:
- YAML frontmatter syntax errors
- Invalid naming conventions
- Missing required fields
- Structural requirement violations
