# Skill Dependency Mapper

A tool for analyzing skill ecosystems to optimize workflows, identify bottlenecks, and recommend effective skill combinations through comprehensive dependency mapping.

<Callout type="tip">
This skill is perfect for developers managing complex skill ecosystems who want to optimize workflow efficiency and understand skill relationships.
</Callout>

## Skill Structure

The repository provides analysis tools and reference materials:

<Card>

**Main Files:**
- **SKILL.md** - Core dependency analysis framework

**Resource Directories:**
- **references/** - Relationship analysis guides and templates
- **scripts/** - Automated dependency detection tools

</Card>

## Core Purpose

The Skill Dependency Mapper analyzes relationships between skills to:
- **Optimize workflows** by identifying complementary skills
- **Detect bottlenecks** causing performance issues
- **Recommend skill stacks** for specific tasks
- **Visualize dependencies** showing how skills interconnect

## Five Core Capabilities

<Card title="1. Skill Analysis">

Extracts comprehensive metadata from each skill:
- Tool dependencies (file I/O, API calls, computation)
- Supported file formats
- Domain categories
- Complexity metrics (token usage, tool calls)

</Card>

<Card title="2. Bottleneck Detection">

Identifies workflow inefficiencies by analyzing:
- High token usage patterns
- Excessive tool call chains
- Performance constraints
- Resource-intensive operations

</Card>

<Card title="3. Dependency Mapping">

Creates text-based visualizations showing:
- Which skills work together effectively
- Shared characteristics and patterns
- Workflow sequences and chains
- Relationship strength indicators

</Card>

<Card title="4. Stack Recommendations">

Suggests optimal skill combinations for:
- Data analysis pipelines
- Document processing workflows
- Financial reporting tasks
- Custom use case scenarios

</Card>

<Card title="5. Custom Analysis">

Filters and analyzes skills by:
- Required tools
- Domain expertise
- Complexity levels
- Specific criteria

</Card>

## Relationship Metrics

Skills are categorized by dependency strength:

<Callout type="info">

**Dependency Categories:**
- **Strong** (3+ shared characteristics) - Highly complementary skills
- **Medium** (2 shared characteristics) - Compatible skill pairs
- **Weak** (1 shared characteristic) - Loosely related skills

</Callout>

## Bottleneck Severity Levels

The system identifies performance issues by severity:

- **Low** - Under 5k tokens, minimal impact
- **Medium** - 5-10k tokens, moderate concern
- **High** - Over 10k tokens with 5+ tool calls, significant bottleneck

## Practical Applications

### Common Use Cases

<Card title="Workflow Optimization">

**Example**: Data Analysis Workflow
- Identify skills for data ingestion, processing, and visualization
- Map dependencies between analysis steps
- Detect bottlenecks in transformation pipelines
- Recommend optimized skill sequences

</Card>

<Card title="Troubleshooting">

**Example**: Document Processing Slowdowns
- Analyze token usage across document skills
- Identify expensive operations
- Find alternative skill combinations
- Suggest performance improvements

</Card>

<Card title="Stack Building">

**Example**: Financial Reporting Stack
- Recommend skills for data extraction, calculation, and reporting
- Ensure compatibility across the stack
- Optimize for performance and accuracy
- Validate complete workflow coverage

</Card>

<Card title="Ecosystem Visualization">

**Example**: Skill Relationship Mapping
- Generate dependency graphs
- Identify skill clusters
- Find redundant capabilities
- Discover integration opportunities

</Card>

## Important Limitations

<Callout type="warning">

**Analysis Constraints:**
- Uses **heuristic-based detection** (not definitive)
- Requires skills in `/mnt/skills` directory structure
- Provides **approximate token estimates**
- Cannot access actual runtime usage patterns
- Relationships inferred from metadata, not execution data

</Callout>

## Analysis Features

The framework provides:

- **Automated metadata extraction** from skill files
- **Text-based dependency visualizations**
- **Performance bottleneck identification**
- **Stack recommendation algorithms**
- **Custom filtering and querying**

## Output Formats

Analysis results include:

1. **Dependency graphs** showing relationships
2. **Bottleneck reports** with severity ratings
3. **Stack recommendations** for specific tasks
4. **Metric summaries** for skill complexity
5. **Relationship matrices** mapping connections

## Repository Resources

The repository includes analysis scripts, relationship detection algorithms, visualization tools, and bottleneck identification frameworks for comprehensive skill ecosystem management.
