# Skill Security Analyzer

A specialized tool designed to evaluate Claude skills for security vulnerabilities, risks, and safety concerns before deployment through comprehensive security assessment and risk categorization.

<Callout type="tip">
This skill is essential for skill developers and library maintainers who need to ensure their skills are secure before deployment and want to identify potential security risks.
</Callout>

## Core Purpose

The Skill Security Analyzer performs comprehensive security assessments to:

- **Scan for vulnerabilities** across all skill components
- **Categorize risks** with severity ratings
- **Evaluate safety** before deployment
- **Conduct security audits** with evidence-based findings

## Security Assessment Functions

<Card title="Vulnerability Scanning">

Comprehensive examination of skill components:
- Metadata review and validation
- Instruction analysis for security patterns
- Script inspection for risky operations
- Asset evaluation for potential threats

</Card>

<Card title="Risk Categorization">

Severity ratings across multiple levels:
- **CRITICAL** - Immediate security threats requiring urgent action
- **HIGH** - Significant risks that should be addressed promptly
- **MEDIUM** - Moderate concerns that need attention
- **LOW** - Minor issues for consideration
- **POSITIVE** - Security best practices identified

</Card>

<Card title="Pre-Deployment Safety">

Evaluation protocols before skill release:
- Safety concern identification
- Third-party skill assessment
- Pattern matching against security anti-patterns
- Context-aware risk evaluation

</Card>

## Systematic Analysis Workflow

<Callout type="info">

**Three-Step Process:**
1. **Extract** - Gather skill contents and components
2. **Review** - Analyze metadata, instructions, and scripts
3. **Cross-reference** - Match patterns against security guidelines

</Callout>

## Analysis Scope

The tool examines multiple dimensions of security:

- **Data Exfiltration Risks** - Unauthorized data transmission
- **Network Access Patterns** - External connection analysis
- **Prompt Injection Vulnerabilities** - Input validation checks
- **File System Operations** - Read/write permission review
- **Command Execution** - Shell and system command inspection
- **Credential Handling** - Secret and token management
- **Third-Party Dependencies** - External library risks
- **Privilege Escalation** - Permission boundary checks
- **Resource Consumption** - DoS and abuse potential
- **Privacy Concerns** - Data handling practices

## Evidence-Based Findings

<Callout type="warning">

**Analysis Principles:**
- Cite specific code locations and references
- Distinguish legitimate functionality from security overreach
- Maintain context-aware evaluation
- Provide actionable remediation guidance
- Avoid assumptions without evidence

</Callout>

## Structured Output Format

Security analysis results include:

1. **Executive Summary** - High-level risk assessment
2. **Detailed Findings** - Specific vulnerabilities with evidence
3. **Security Checklists** - Compliance verification
4. **Severity Ratings** - Categorized risk levels
5. **Remediation Guidance** - Specific fix recommendations
6. **Code References** - Exact locations of concerns

## Activation Triggers

The analyzer activates when you request:

- Security analysis of skills
- Vulnerability assessments
- Security audits
- Safety evaluations
- Risk identification
- Pre-deployment security checks

Common trigger phrases:
- "analyze security"
- "security risks"
- "security audit"
- "is this skill safe"

## Key Features

<Card title=".skill File Support">

Extracts and analyzes packaged skills:
- Automated content extraction
- Component separation
- Comprehensive file review
- Asset security validation

</Card>

<Card title="Third-Party Assessment">

Evaluate skills from external sources:
- Unknown skill inspection
- Vendor security review
- Community skill validation
- Trust verification protocols

</Card>

<Card title="Pattern Matching">

Identifies known security anti-patterns:
- Command injection patterns
- Data exfiltration signatures
- Privilege escalation attempts
- Resource abuse indicators

</Card>

## Security Best Practices Detection

The analyzer also identifies positive security patterns:

- Proper input validation
- Secure credential handling
- Appropriate permission scoping
- Safe file operations
- Defensive programming practices

## Repository Resources

The repository includes security assessment frameworks, vulnerability scanning tools, risk categorization systems, and remediation guides for comprehensive skill security evaluation.
