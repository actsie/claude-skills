# Family History Research Planning

Strategic genealogy research planning following the Genealogical Proof Standard (GPS). Provides methodology guidance, citation templates, source evaluation frameworks, and evidence-based research planning for family historians.

<Callout type="tip">
Perfect for genealogists, family historians, and anyone conducting serious ancestry research who wants to follow professional standards and best practices.
</Callout>

## Core Principles

<Card title="Genealogical Proof Standard (GPS)">

**Five Elements of GPS:**

1. **Reasonably Exhaustive Research**
   - Search all relevant sources
   - Check multiple record types
   - Consider alternative spellings
   - Examine collateral lines

2. **Complete and Accurate Citations**
   - Source every claim
   - Follow "Evidence Explained" standards
   - Enable others to find your sources
   - Distinguish between original and derivative

3. **Thorough Analysis**
   - Evaluate source reliability
   - Consider information accuracy
   - Assess evidence quality
   - Test alternative hypotheses

4. **Resolution of Conflicts**
   - Identify contradictions
   - Weigh conflicting evidence
   - Explain discrepancies
   - Reach reasoned conclusions

5. **Soundly Written Conclusion**
   - State your finding clearly
   - Explain your reasoning
   - Acknowledge limitations
   - Document evidence trail

</Card>

## How It Works

**1. Information Gathering**
```
What do you know about your ancestor?
- Name: John Smith
- Birth: ~1820, possibly Virginia
- Death: 1892, Kentucky
- Spouse: Mary (unknown maiden name)
- Children: 5 (names and dates needed)
```

**2. Research Strategy**
```
Recommended search sequence:
1. Find death record (1892 Kentucky)
2. Search cemetery records for burial
3. Check 1850-1890 census (track movements)
4. Look for marriage record (estimate 1840s)
5. Search land records (property ownership)
6. Check probate (will or estate inventory)
```

**3. Source Evaluation**
```
For each source found:
- Original or derivative?
- Primary or secondary information?
- Direct or indirect evidence?
- Reliability assessment
- Citation creation
```

**4. Evidence Analysis**
```
Compile findings:
- What supports birth in Virginia?
- What conflicts with this theory?
- What's still unknown?
- What are alternative explanations?
```

## Usage Examples

**Start new research:**
```
I'm researching my great-great-grandfather James Wilson,
born around 1845 in Ohio. I know he married Sarah (unknown)
and had 3 children. Help me create a research plan.
```

**Cite a source:**
```
I found James Wilson in the 1870 census. How should I cite
this according to Evidence Explained standards?
```

**Evaluate evidence:**
```
I have three different birth years for James: 1843, 1845,
and 1847. Help me analyze these conflicting sources.
```

**Plan next steps:**
```
I've exhausted census and vital records for James. What
should I search next to find his parents?
```

## Citation Examples

### Census Records

```
Evidence Explained Format:

1870 U.S. census, Hamilton County, Ohio, population schedule,
Cincinnati Ward 12, p. 147 (stamped), dwelling 1,204, family 1,305,
James Wilson household; digital image, Ancestry.com
(https://www.ancestry.com : accessed 15 March 2024);
citing NARA microfilm publication M593, roll 1209.
```

### Vital Records

```
Birth Certificate:

Ohio, Hamilton County, Birth Certificates, 1867-1908,
certificate no. 4392 (1875), Mary E. Wilson; Hamilton County
Probate Court, Cincinnati; FHL microfilm 310,439.
```

### Church Records

```
Baptism Record:

First Presbyterian Church (Cincinnati, Ohio), "Baptismal Register,
1850-1890," p. 47, entry for Sarah Jane Wilson, baptized 3 June 1872;
church archives, Cincinnati.
```

## Research Planning Framework

**Phase 1: What You Know**
- Names (all variants and spellings)
- Dates (with uncertainty ranges)
- Places (specific as possible)
- Relationships (parents, siblings, children)

**Phase 2: What You Need**
- Missing birth/death dates
- Unknown maiden names
- Parents' identities
- Migration timeline

**Phase 3: Where to Look**
- Census (every available year)
- Vital records (birth, marriage, death)
- Church records (baptism, marriage, burial)
- Land records (deeds, tax lists)
- Probate (wills, estate files)
- Newspapers (obituaries, notices)
- Military (service, pension)

**Phase 4: How to Search**
- Spelling variations (Smyth, Smythe, Schmidt)
- Nearby counties (records cross borders)
- Collateral relatives (siblings, in-laws)
- Local histories (published genealogies)

## Source Reliability Framework

**Original vs. Derivative**
- Original: Created at the time (birth certificate from 1875)
- Derivative: Copy or transcript (database transcription)

**Primary vs. Secondary Information**
- Primary: Informant had direct knowledge (bride's age on marriage record)
- Secondary: Informant didn't witness (father's birthplace on death certificate)

**Direct vs. Indirect Evidence**
- Direct: Answers question directly (birth record gives birth date)
- Indirect: Requires inference (age in census implies birth year)

**Reliability Hierarchy:**
```
Highest: Original source, primary information, direct evidence
         (Birth certificate signed by attending physician)

High:    Original source, primary information, indirect evidence
         (Marriage record implying ages)

Medium:  Derivative source, primary information, direct evidence
         (Database copy of will)

Low:     Derivative source, secondary information, indirect evidence
         (Family tree on Ancestry with no citations)
```

## Conflict Resolution

**Example: Three Different Birth Years**

```
Source 1: 1870 Census
- Age: 25 → Birth: ~1845
- Reliability: Original, secondary, indirect
- Notes: Age often estimated

Source 2: Death Certificate (1920)
- Age at death: 75 → Birth: ~1845
- Reliability: Original, secondary, indirect
- Notes: Informant was daughter (may not know)

Source 3: Gravestone
- Born: 1843
- Reliability: Original (?), unknown, direct
- Notes: Could be engraver error

Analysis:
Two independent sources (census, death cert) agree on ~1845.
Gravestone is least reliable due to frequent engraver errors.

Conclusion:
James likely born 1845 ± 1 year. Continue searching for birth
record or baptism to confirm.

## Research Log Template

```

```

## Evidence Evaluation

**For each piece of information, ask:**

1. **Who created this record?**
   (Government official, church, family member)

2. **When was it created?**
   (At the time of event, or years later)

3. **What was their source of knowledge?**
   (Witnessed it, heard from participant, guessed)

4. **Do they have reason to lie/distort?**
   (Legal implications, social stigma, memory failure)

5. **Does this agree with other evidence?**
   (Corroborates or conflicts)

## Best Practices

<Callout type="warning">

**Always:**
- ✅ Gather information from the user first
- ✅ Create research strategy before searching
- ✅ Cite every source properly
- ✅ Evaluate evidence systematically
- ✅ Document what you searched (even if nothing found)
- ✅ Consider alternative hypotheses

**Never:**
- ❌ Immediately search the web without planning
- ❌ Accept information without sources
- ❌ Ignore conflicting evidence
- ❌ Assume spelling was consistent
- ❌ Skip negative search results in log
- ❌ Stop at first answer found
