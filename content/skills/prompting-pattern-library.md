## Core Philosophy

### Pattern-Based Prompting Over Ad-Hoc Approaches

Effective AI interaction relies on proven patterns rather than improvised prompts:

- **Reusable Templates**: Standardized approaches for common tasks
- **Predictable Outcomes**: Consistent results through structured prompting
- **Model Optimization**: Patterns tailored to specific AI model strengths
- **Failure Prevention**: Understanding and avoiding common prompt failures

<Card title="Prompting Success Factors">

**Effective Patterns:**
- Clear role and context definition
- Specific output format requirements
- Step-by-step reasoning guidance
- Relevant examples and demonstrations
- Error handling and edge case coverage

**Common Failures:**
- Vague or ambiguous instructions
- Missing context or constraints
- Overwhelming complexity in single prompts
- Inconsistent formatting expectations
- Lack of validation or feedback loops

</Card>

3. Finally, [conclusion/recommendation]
```

**Few-Shot Learning:**
```
Here are examples of the desired output:
