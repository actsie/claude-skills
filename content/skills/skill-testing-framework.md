# Skill Testing Framework

A comprehensive testing solution designed to validate skill functionality across multiple testing levels, enabling developers to create, execute, and manage test suites that ensure skills operate correctly through updates.

<Callout type="tip">
This framework is perfect for skill developers who want to maintain quality, catch regressions, and ensure their skills work correctly across different scenarios and edge cases.
</Callout>

## Core Purpose

The Skill Testing Framework helps you:

- **Validate functionality** across unit, integration, and regression tests
- **Automate testing** with template generation and test runners
- **Catch breaking changes** before they reach production
- **Maintain quality** through continuous validation

## Three Testing Levels

<Card title="1. Unit Tests">

Test individual skill components in isolation:
- Single function validation
- Component-level testing
- Basic functionality verification
- Quick feedback on changes

</Card>

<Card title="2. Integration Tests">

Validate complete workflows:
- End-to-end skill execution
- Multi-component interaction
- Real-world scenario testing
- Workflow sequence validation

</Card>

<Card title="3. Regression Tests">

Catch breaking changes:
- Baseline comparison
- Historical output validation
- Version compatibility checks
- Change impact detection

</Card>

## Key Testing Features

<Card title="Automated Test Generation">

Create test templates based on skill structure:
- Analyze skill capabilities
- Generate appropriate test cases
- Scaffold test files automatically
- Customize generated templates

</Card>

<Card title="Input/Output Validation">

Multiple matching strategies for flexible testing:
- **Exact Matching** - For deterministic outputs
- **Content Containment** - Check for required elements
- **Regex Pattern Matching** - Validate format and structure
- **Structural Validation** - Document-based result verification

</Card>

<Card title="Baseline Management">

Track expected outputs over time:
- Create baseline outputs
- Compare against baselines
- Update baselines intentionally
- Version baseline changes

</Card>

<Card title="Comprehensive Reporting">

Detailed test results and summaries:
- Pass/fail status for each test
- Verbose debugging output
- Diff views for failures
- Summary statistics

</Card>

## Test Organization Structure

<Callout type="info">

**Directory Layout:**
```
/tests/
  ├── definitions/     # Test case definitions
  ├── inputs/          # Input fixtures
  ├── baselines/       # Expected output baselines
  └── outputs/         # Actual test outputs
```

This structure maintains clear separation and improves maintainability.

</Callout>

## Validation Methods

The framework offers four validation approaches:

<Card title="Exact Matching">

For deterministic outputs:
- Character-by-character comparison
- No tolerance for differences
- Best for predictable results
- Fastest validation method

</Card>

<Card title="Content Containment">

Check for required elements:
- Verify key phrases present
- Ensure critical data included
- Flexible ordering
- Partial match acceptance

</Card>

<Card title="Regex Pattern Matching">

Validate format and structure:
- Pattern-based validation
- Format verification
- Flexible content matching
- Structure enforcement

</Card>

<Card title="Structural Validation">

Document-based result verification:
- JSON structure validation
- XML schema checking
- Object property verification
- Type checking

</Card>

## Available Tools

The framework provides three main tools:

<Card title="Test Template Generator">

Rapid test creation:
- Analyzes skill structure
- Generates test definitions
- Creates input fixtures
- Scaffolds test files

**Usage**: Run generator on skill files to create initial test suite

</Card>

<Card title="Test Runner">

Execute test suites:
- Runs all or specific tests
- Provides verbose debugging
- Captures outputs
- Reports results

**Usage**: Execute tests with detailed logging for troubleshooting

</Card>

<Card title="Results Validator">

Compare and validate outputs:
- Baseline comparison
- Create new baselines
- Diff generation
- Pass/fail determination

**Usage**: Validate test outputs against expected results

</Card>

## Best Practices

<Callout type="warning">

**Baseline Management:**

**DO:**
- Review changes before updating baselines
- Document why baselines changed
- Keep baselines version-controlled
- Create baselines intentionally

**DON'T:**
- Blindly update baselines when tests fail
- Ignore baseline differences
- Commit broken baselines
- Skip baseline review

</Callout>

## Testing Workflow

<Card title="Recommended Approach">

**1. Start with Basic Functionality**
- Test core capabilities first
- Validate happy path scenarios
- Ensure fundamental operations work

**2. Add Edge Cases**
- Test boundary conditions
- Handle invalid inputs
- Check error scenarios
- Validate edge behavior

**3. Incorporate Integration Tests**
- Test complete workflows
- Validate multi-step processes
- Check component interactions

**4. Maintain Regression Tests**
- Lock in expected behavior
- Catch breaking changes
- Verify compatibility
- Track historical performance

</Card>

## Test Independence

<Callout type="info">

**Important Principle:**

Each test should be independent and self-contained:
- No shared state between tests
- Isolated test execution
- Reproducible results
- Clear setup and teardown

</Callout>

## Documentation Practices

Well-documented tests are critical:

- Describe what each test validates
- Explain expected behavior
- Document edge cases covered
- Note any assumptions

## Script and Workflow Support

The framework handles different skill types:

<Card title="Script-Based Skills">

Test executable scripts:
- Validate script outputs
- Check exit codes
- Test error handling
- Verify side effects

</Card>

<Card title="Workflow-Based Skills">

Test multi-step processes:
- Validate workflow stages
- Check state transitions
- Test data flow
- Verify final outputs

</Card>
