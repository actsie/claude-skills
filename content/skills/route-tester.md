# Route Tester

Comprehensive testing framework for authenticated API routes using cookie-based JWT authentication, with patterns for validation, debugging, and ensuring route functionality works correctly in development and production.

<Callout type="tip">
Essential for testing Express.js APIs with JWT authentication and debugging authentication flows.
</Callout>

## Core Purpose

This skill provides testing patterns for:

- **Authenticated Routes**: Test endpoints requiring JWT tokens
- **Cookie-Based Auth**: Handle cookie authentication flows
- **Route Validation**: Verify endpoint behavior and responses
- **Mock Authentication**: Test without full auth setup
- **Debugging Tools**: Identify authentication issues
- **Integration Testing**: End-to-end API testing

## Key Features

<Card title="API Testing Patterns">

**Authentication Testing:**
- JWT token generation
- Cookie-based authentication
- Mock user sessions
- Token refresh flows

**Route Validation:**
- Request/response validation
- Status code verification
- Error handling testing
- Edge case coverage

**Debugging Tools:**
- Authentication flow tracing
- Cookie inspection
- Token validation
- Error diagnostics

**Test Organization:**
- Test script patterns
- Setup and teardown
- Test data management
- Assertion libraries

</Card>

## Use Cases

Perfect for:
- **API Testing**: Validate Express.js routes
- **Auth Debugging**: Troubleshoot JWT issues
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end API testing
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automated route testing
- **Development**: Quick route validation

## Getting Started

1. **Set Up Tests**: Create test scripts for routes
2. **Configure Auth**: Set up JWT mock authentication
3. **Write Tests**: Validate route behavior
4. **Run Tests**: Execute and verify results
5. **Debug Issues**: Use debugging patterns

## Technology Stack

- Express.js routes
- JWT authentication
- Cookie-based sessions
- Testing frameworks
- Mock authentication
