# Skill Seekers

An automated conversion system that transforms documentation websites into production-ready Claude AI skills through intelligent scraping, content organization, and AI-powered enhancement.

<Callout type="tip">
This tool is essential for developers who want to create custom Claude skills from their favorite frameworks, game engines, or internal documentation without manual content organization.
</Callout>

## Core Purpose

Skill Seekers automates the entire process of creating Claude skills from documentation:

- **Scrape documentation websites** automatically and intelligently
- **Extract PDF documents** including scanned PDFs via OCR
- **Organize content** into categorized reference files
- **Enhance with AI** to extract examples and key concepts
- **Package everything** into uploadable `.zip` files for Claude

## Three Access Methods

<Card title="1. Claude Code Integration">

Use natural language commands directly in Claude Code:

</Card>

## Configuration Options

### Custom Scraping Rules

Define URL patterns, content selectors, and filtering rules:

```json
{
  "base_url": "https://docs.example.com",
  "url_patterns": ["/docs/**"],
  "exclude_patterns": ["/blog/**"],
  "content_selector": "article.content",
  "max_pages": 1000
}
```

### Content Organization

Specify categorization and structure:

```json
{
  "categories": {
    "api": "API Reference",
    "guides": "User Guides",
    "examples": "Code Examples"
  },
  "auto_detect_language": true
}
```

## Handling Large Documentation

<Callout type="info">

**For 10,000+ Pages:**

Use router/hub skill architecture:
1. Create main hub skill
2. Split documentation by major sections
3. Generate sub-skills for each section
4. Hub routes queries to appropriate sub-skill
5. Maintains context across skills

This approach keeps skills under token limits while handling massive documentation.

</Callout>

## Best Practices

### Efficient Scraping

**Optimization Tips:**
- Use `estimate_pages.py` before full scraping
- Enable caching for iterative development
- Set appropriate rate limits
- Filter unnecessary pages early
- Use parallel processing for large sites

### Content Quality

**Enhancement Strategies:**
- Enable AI enhancement for key sections
- Extract code examples separately
- Preserve original documentation structure
- Include cross-references and links
- Test skill with real queries

### Skill Organization

**Structuring Guidelines:**
- Logical categorization by topic
- Clear reference file naming
- Comprehensive SKILL.md instructions
- Include usage examples
- Document skill capabilities

## Troubleshooting

<Card title="Common Issues">

**Scraping Fails:**
- Check URL accessibility
- Verify selectors match site structure
- Review rate limits
- Check for anti-scraping measures

**Large Documentation:**
- Use router/hub architecture
- Enable checkpointing
- Process in smaller batches
- Consider splitting by version

**Enhancement Issues:**
- Verify API key configuration
- Check token limits
- Review content formatting
- Test with smaller sections first
