## Core Problem

Most organizations approach AI vendor selection haphazardly, leading to:

- **95% failure rate** in AI project implementations
- Costly vendor lock-in with poor performance
- Unrealistic expectations set by vendor promises
- Complex integrations that fail at scale
- Legal and contractual complications

This framework provides systematic evaluation to avoid these pitfalls.

## Evaluation Framework

### Phase 1: Initial Screening

<Card title="Red Flag Elimination">

**Purpose**: Quickly eliminate problematic vendors before deep evaluation.

**Key Criteria:**
- Domain experience verification
- Customer reference quality
- Technology approach assessment
- Pricing transparency
- Implementation timeline realism

**Immediate Disqualifiers:**
- No domain-specific case studies
- Unwillingness to provide references
- Vague technical explanations
- Pricing opacity
- Unrealistic promises

</Card>

### Phase 2: Deep Evaluation

**Technical Assessment:**
- Model performance benchmarks
- Integration complexity analysis
- Scalability evaluation
- Security and compliance review
- Data handling practices

**Business Viability:**
- Financial stability assessment
- Market position analysis
- Support quality evaluation
- Roadmap alignment
- Partnership approach

**Pricing Analysis:**
- Cost structure transparency
- Scaling economics
- Hidden fee identification
- ROI projection validation
- Competitive positioning

### Phase 3: Contract Negotiation

<Card title="Critical Contract Terms">

**Performance Guarantees:**
- SLA definitions and penalties
- Accuracy thresholds
- Uptime commitments
- Response time requirements

**Data Rights:**
- Data ownership clarity
- Usage restrictions
- Retention policies
- Portability guarantees

**Financial Protection:**
- Pricing escalation limits
- Termination clauses
- Liability caps
- Refund policies

</Card>

## Vendor Pattern Recognition

### Common Vendor Types

<Card title="The Overpromiser">

**Characteristics:**
- Claims near-perfect accuracy
- Promises unrealistic timelines
- Minimizes integration complexity
- Avoids discussing limitations

**Red Flags:**
- "Our AI can do anything"
- No discussion of edge cases
- Pressure for quick decisions
- Unwillingness to show failures

**Handling Strategy:**
- Demand proof of concept
- Request failure case studies
- Insist on pilot programs
- Verify all claims independently

</Card>

<Card title="The Feature Dumper">

**Characteristics:**
- Overwhelming feature lists
- Kitchen sink approach
- Complex pricing models
- Poor focus on core use case

**Red Flags:**
- 50+ features in demo
- Unclear core competency
- Complex configuration requirements
- One-size-fits-all messaging

**Handling Strategy:**
- Focus on specific use case
- Ignore irrelevant features
- Test core functionality only
- Negotiate feature-specific pricing

</Card>

### The Consultant in Disguise

**Characteristics:**
- Heavy services component
- Custom development emphasis
- High professional services costs
- Limited productized offerings

**Evaluation Approach:**
- Separate product from services costs
- Assess internal capability requirements
- Evaluate long-term dependency risks
- Compare to pure product alternatives

## Decision Support Tools

### Build vs. Buy Framework

<Card title="Decision Criteria">

**Build When:**
- Core differentiating capability
- Unique data advantages
- High customization needs
- Strong internal AI expertise
- Long-term strategic importance

**Buy When:**
- Commoditized functionality
- Rapid deployment needed
- Limited internal resources
- Proven market solutions exist
- Non-core business function

**Hybrid When:**
- Partial internal capability
- Platform + customization approach
- Vendor partnership opportunities
- Risk mitigation strategies

</Card>
