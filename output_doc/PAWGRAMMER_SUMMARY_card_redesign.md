## Feature: Skill Card Redesign - Compact Hero Format

### üéØ What Was Built

The skill cards on the homepage have been completely redesigned to showcase each skill as a "mini product" with clear value propositions. Instead of just listing information, each card now tells you what the skill does, how it helps, and who it's for.

- **New visual design**: Cards now have a subtle gradient border that glows when you hover over them, making them feel more interactive and modern
- **Better information hierarchy**: The most important information (title and description) is at the top, with supporting details (category, tags, author, date) at the bottom
- **Cleaner layout**: Removed unnecessary icons and avatars, giving more space for the actual content
- **Consistent styling**: All three sections (main catalog, featured skills, and newest skills) now have the same professional look
- **Featured badge redesign**: Featured skills get a subtle, glossy badge in the top-right corner with a white sparkle effect
- **How it helps**: You can now quickly scan cards to understand what each skill does and decide if it's useful for you

### üß™ How to Test This Feature

**Follow these exact steps:**

1. **Open the application**
   - Use the "Start Server" button in Pawgrammer, OR
   - Open your terminal and run: `npm run dev`
   - Your browser will automatically open to: `http://localhost:3000`
   - **You should see**: The homepage with skill cards in a grid layout

2. **Check the new card design**
   - Look at any skill card on the page
   - **You should see**:
     - A white/gray card with rounded corners
     - A subtle glow around the edges when you hover your mouse over it
     - The skill title at the top in bold text
     - The description below in medium-weight text
     - A gray category badge at the bottom (like "development" or "marketing")
     - Tags next to the category (like "#typescript" or "#code-review")
     - Author name and "4 days ago" at the very bottom

3. **Test the featured badge**
   - Scroll to the "Featured Skills" section
   - Look at the top-right corner of any card
   - **You should see**: A small badge that says "FEATURED" with a subtle gray background and a white sparkle in the corner
   - The badge should stay on top of everything else

4. **Test the hover effect**
   - Move your mouse over any skill card
   - **You should see**:
     - The card slightly grows (scales up by 1%)
     - The gradient border becomes more visible (glows more)
     - The shadow gets larger
     - Your cursor changes to a pointer (hand icon)

5. **Check the sorting menu**
   - Find the "Sort:" dropdown in the top-right area
   - Click on it to open the menu
   - **You should see**: A dropdown with three options (Featured, Newest, Relevance)
   - The dropdown should appear ABOVE any featured badges (not behind them)

6. **Verify consistency across sections**
   - Scroll through all three sections: main catalog, "Featured Skills", and "Just Added"
   - **You should see**: All cards have the same design, just different heights (main cards are taller)
   - Author names and dates should show on all cards

## üöÄ How to Run This Project

**Automatic (Recommended):**
- Use the "Start Server" button in the Pawgrammer interface

**Manual (If automatic doesn't work):**

1. **Locate the project folder**:
   - It's at: `/Users/stacyenot/Projects/skilltree/skill-web`

2. **Start the application**:
   - **For this Next.js app**:
     - Open your terminal (Command+Space, type "terminal", press Enter)
     - Type: `cd /Users/stacyenot/Projects/skilltree/skill-web`
     - Type: `npm run dev`
     - A development server will start automatically
     - Open your browser to: `http://localhost:3000`
     - You'll see the app running

3. **What you should see**:
   - The homepage with a search bar at the top
   - Three sections: "Featured Skills", "Just Added", and the main catalog
   - Skill cards in a grid layout (3 columns on desktop, 1 column on mobile)
   - Filter buttons at the top (All, Development, Marketing, etc.)
   - A sort dropdown on the right

**Troubleshooting:**
- **"Port already in use" error**: Close any other instances of the app and try again
- **Blank screen**: Check the browser console (F12) - there might be an error with the build
- **Cards look different**: Make sure you ran `npm run build` before `npm run dev` to regenerate the search index
- **"Module not found" error**: Run `npm install` first to install dependencies
