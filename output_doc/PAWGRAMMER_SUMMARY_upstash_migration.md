## Feature: Upstash Redis Migration

### üéØ What Was Built

This session migrated the analytics caching layer from Vercel KV (discontinued) to Upstash Redis. This change is invisible to users but essential for the analytics system to function in production.

- **Database migration**: Switched from Vercel KV to Upstash Redis for storing analytics data
- **Package update**: Replaced @vercel/kv with @upstash/redis npm package
- **Code updates**: Updated 5 API route files to use the new Redis client
- **Documentation update**: Revised ANALYTICS_RUNBOOK.md with new procedures for Upstash
- **Why this matters**: The analytics features (Trending, Featured, Newest sections) need a database to store view/click counters. Without this migration, these features would not work in production.

### üß™ How to Test This Feature

**Note:** This feature requires production environment variables to fully test. Here's how to verify the migration:

1. **Verify the build succeeds**
   - The application should build without errors
   - Run: `npm run build`
   - **You should see**: "‚úì Compiled successfully" with no Redis-related errors

2. **Check the application runs locally**
   - Start the dev server: `npm run dev`
   - Open browser to: `http://localhost:3000` or `http://localhost:3001`
   - **Expected result**: Page loads showing skills marketplace
   - Note: Trending/Featured/Newest sections will show loading states without Redis credentials

3. **Verify code changes**
   - Check that these files import from `@upstash/redis`:
     - `app/api/analytics/track/route.ts`
     - `app/api/cron/compute-trending/route.ts`
     - `app/api/trending/route.ts`
     - `app/api/featured/route.ts`
     - `app/api/newest/route.ts`
   - Each should have: `import { Redis } from '@upstash/redis';`

### üìù Technical Details (for reference)
- Files changed:
  - `package.json` (dependency swap)
  - `app/api/analytics/track/route.ts`
  - `app/api/cron/compute-trending/route.ts`
  - `app/api/trending/route.ts`
  - `app/api/featured/route.ts`
  - `app/api/newest/route.ts`
  - `ANALYTICS_RUNBOOK.md`
- Dependencies removed: `@vercel/kv`
- New dependencies: `@upstash/redis`
- Environment variables needed (production only):
  - `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL`
  - `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN`

## üöÄ How to Deploy This Project

**Prerequisites:**
1. You have a Vercel account
2. You have access to the project repository
3. You have the credentials ready (PostHog, GA4, Upstash)

**Deployment Steps:**

### Step 1: Set Up Upstash Redis

1. **Install Upstash integration in Vercel:**
   - Go to your Vercel project dashboard
   - Click "Storage" tab
   - Click "Connect Store"
   - Select "Upstash Redis"
   - Click "Create Database" or connect existing
   - This will automatically inject `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` and `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` into your environment variables

2. **Verify integration:**
   - Go to Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
   - Confirm you see:
     - `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL`
     - `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN`

### Step 2: Configure Analytics Environment Variables

Add these environment variables in Vercel (Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables):

**PostHog Configuration:**
- Variable: `NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY`
- Value: `phc_hXUH0QfsiKv69pBVVDKCCAcAKo2K2OElQxTezt19Jku`
- Environments: Production, Preview, Development

- Variable: `NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_HOST`
- Value: `https://us.i.posthog.com`
- Environments: Production, Preview, Development

**Google Analytics 4:**
- Variable: `NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID`
- Value: `G-QH1NVZY8SL`
- Environments: Production, Preview, Development

**Cron Job Security:**
- Variable: `CRON_SECRET`
- Value: Generate with `openssl rand -base64 32` or use any secure random string
- Environments: Production, Preview

### Step 3: Deploy to Vercel

**Option A: Automatic deployment (recommended)**
1. Push your changes to the main branch
2. Vercel will automatically deploy

**Option B: Manual deployment**
```bash
vercel deploy --prod
```

### Step 4: Verify Deployment

1. **Check the application loads:**
   - Visit your production URL
   - Confirm the homepage displays correctly
   - Check browser console for errors (F12)

2. **Verify analytics is working:**
   - Navigate around the site
   - Visit a skill detail page
   - Check PostHog dashboard (https://us.i.posthog.com) for new events
   - Events should appear within 1-2 minutes

3. **Verify cron job:**
   - Wait until midnight UTC (or manually trigger via API)
   - Check Vercel logs for cron execution
   - Look for log entry: "[Cron] Computing trending skills..."
   - Visit `/api/trending` - should return JSON with trending skills

4. **Test Trending/Featured/Newest sections:**
   - After some user activity (views/clicks), trending section should populate
   - Featured skills should display based on manual `featured: true` in markdown
   - Newest section should show the 6 most recently added skills

**Troubleshooting:**
- **Trending section empty**: Normal on fresh deploy. Wait for user activity and cron job to run.
- **Analytics events not appearing in PostHog**: Check browser console for errors, verify PostHog key is correct
- **500 errors on API routes**: Check Vercel logs, verify Upstash Redis environment variables are set
- **Cron job not running**: Verify `CRON_SECRET` is set in environment variables, check `vercel.json` has cron configuration

## üîê Next Steps (Deployment Checklist)

Before your analytics system is fully operational, complete these steps:

- [ ] Install Upstash Redis integration in Vercel (auto-injects credentials)
- [ ] Add `NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY` to Vercel environment variables
- [ ] Add `NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_HOST` to Vercel environment variables
- [ ] Add `NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID` to Vercel environment variables
- [ ] Generate and add `CRON_SECRET` to Vercel environment variables
- [ ] Deploy to production (push to main or `vercel deploy --prod`)
- [ ] Verify application loads without errors
- [ ] Check PostHog dashboard for incoming events
- [ ] Wait until midnight UTC (or manually trigger cron) and verify job runs successfully
- [ ] Monitor Vercel logs for any errors in first 24 hours

**Important Notes:**
- The cron job runs once daily at midnight UTC and computes trending skills based on view/click counters
- Trending section updates daily - expect up to 24 hours between updates (compatible with Vercel Hobby plan)
- Trending section will be empty until there is user activity (views and clicks)
- Featured section uses manual flags in skill markdown files (`featured: true`)
- Newest section shows skills sorted by `date` field in frontmatter
- All analytics data has automatic TTLs (24h-8d) - no manual cleanup needed
