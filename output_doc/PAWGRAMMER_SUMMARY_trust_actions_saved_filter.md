## Feature: Discord Webhook Integration

### üéØ What Was Built

A Discord webhook integration was added to receive real-time notifications when users submit "Not helpful" feedback with reasons. This helps you understand why users find certain skills unhelpful so you can improve them.

- **Discord notifications**: When someone clicks "Not helpful" and provides a reason, a message is automatically sent to your Discord channel
- **Detailed feedback**: The notification includes the skill name, the specific reason selected, any additional notes the user wrote, and current voting stats
- **Environment setup**: The webhook URL was securely configured in your local development environment

### üß™ How to Test This Feature

**Follow these exact steps:**

1. **Make sure the application is running**
   - Open your browser to: `http://localhost:3000`
   - Navigate to any skill detail page (click on any skill card)

2. **Submit negative feedback**
   - Scroll down to the "Trust & Actions" section on the right side
   - Click the thumbs down (Not helpful) button
   - **You should see**: Several colored chips appear with different reasons
   - Click one of the reason chips (like "Outdated" or "Doesn't work")
   - Optionally, add a note in the text box that appears
   - Click "Submit"

3. **Check Discord**
   - Open your Discord server
   - Go to the channel connected to the webhook
   - **You should see**: A new message appear with:
     - The skill title
     - The reason you selected
     - Your note (if you added one)
     - Current voting statistics
     - A red color-coded message showing it's negative feedback

### üìù Technical Details (for reference)
- Files changed:
  - `.env.local` (added DISCORD_FEEDBACK_WEBHOOK)
  - `app/api/skills/[id]/vote/route.ts` (added logging)
  - `lib/voting/discord.ts` (added extensive logging)
- New dependencies: None
- Configuration changes: Added Discord webhook URL to environment variables

## Feature: Redis Credentials Configuration

### üéØ What Was Built

Fixed the application's connection to Upstash Redis, which stores all the voting data, view counts, and saved skills. Without these credentials, the Trust & Actions features were returning 500 errors.

- **Database connection**: Connected the local development environment to Upstash Redis
- **Environment variables**: Added all necessary Redis credentials to the `.env.local` file
- **Error resolution**: Fixed the 500 Internal Server errors that were preventing votes and saves from working

### üß™ How to Test This Feature

**Follow these exact steps:**

1. **Open any skill detail page**
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
   - Click on any skill card to open its detail page

2. **Check that metrics load**
   - Look at the "Trust & Actions" section on the right
   - **You should see**:
     - Numbers next to the eye icon (views)
     - Numbers next to the thumbs up (helpful votes)
     - Numbers next to the thumbs down (not helpful votes)
   - **You should NOT see**: "New" or loading placeholders

3. **Test voting**
   - Click the thumbs up (Helpful) button
   - **You should see**: The number next to the thumbs up increases by 1
   - Refresh the page
   - **You should see**: Your vote is still there (the thumbs up button is highlighted and disabled)

### üìù Technical Details (for reference)
- Files changed:
  - `.env.local` (added 7 Redis-related environment variables)
- New dependencies: None
- Configuration changes:
  - Added `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL`
  - Added `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN`
  - Added custom prefixed variables for compatibility

## Feature: Fixed Trust & Actions Sticky Positioning

### üéØ What Was Built

Fixed the layout issue where the "Trust & Actions" section (voting buttons) would overlap with the "Repository" section (GitHub link) when scrolling down the page. Now both sections are visible at the same time without overlapping.

- **Better spacing**: Added proper vertical spacing between the Repository and Trust & Actions sections
- **Correct positioning**: Adjusted the sticky positioning so both sections stay visible when scrolling
- **Visual improvement**: Now you can see both the GitHub link and the voting buttons at the same time

### üß™ How to Test This Feature

**Follow these exact steps:**

1. **Open a skill detail page**
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
   - Click on any skill card to view its details

2. **Scroll down the page**
   - Use your mouse wheel or trackpad to scroll down through the skill content
   - **You should see**:
     - The "Repository" section (with the GitHub button) stays at the top of the right sidebar
     - Below it, there's visible white space
     - The "Trust & Actions" section (with voting buttons) appears below with clear separation
   - **You should NOT see**: The two sections overlapping or sitting on top of each other

3. **Continue scrolling**
   - Keep scrolling down
   - **You should see**: Both sections move with your scroll, but maintain their spacing
   - They should act like sticky notes that follow you down the page

### üìù Technical Details (for reference)
- Files changed:
  - `components/TrustActions.tsx` (changed `top-24` to `top-64`)
- New dependencies: None
- Configuration changes: None

## Feature: Saved Skills Filter System

### üéØ What Was Built

Created a complete system for filtering skills by which ones you've saved. When you bookmark a skill, it gets saved to your browser, and now you can view just your saved skills with a single click in the filter menu.

- **"Saved Skills" filter button**: A new option in the "Filter & Discover" menu that shows only your bookmarked skills
- **Dynamic count**: Shows how many skills you've saved right next to the button
- **Helpful tooltip**: When you hover over the bookmark button, a tooltip explains where to find your saved skills
- **Works everywhere**: The "Saved Skills" button appears in all views (desktop, mobile, expanded menu)
- **Visual feedback**: The button uses the same blue color scheme as the bookmark, making the connection obvious

### üß™ How to Test This Feature

**Follow these exact steps:**

1. **Save some skills first**
   - Go to `http://localhost:3000`
   - Click on any skill card to open its detail page
   - Find the "Trust & Actions" section on the right side
   - Click the bookmark icon (looks like a ribbon)
   - **You should see**: The bookmark icon fills in with blue color

   - Go back to the homepage and repeat for 2-3 more skills

2. **Open the filter menu**
   - Go back to the homepage (`http://localhost:3000`)
   - Look at the top of the page for a button that says "Filter & Discover" (on desktop) or a filter icon (on mobile)

   - **You should see**: A dropdown menu appears

3. **Find the Saved Skills button**
   - In the opened menu, look near the top (below the "Featured" button)
   - **You should see**: A button labeled "Saved Skills" with a bookmark icon
   - Next to it in small text, you'll see a number in parentheses (like "(3)")
   - This number shows how many skills you've saved

4. **Click to filter**
   - Click the "Saved Skills" button
   - **You should see**:
     - The button highlights in blue (showing it's active)
     - The menu closes
     - The main page now shows ONLY the skills you bookmarked
     - All other skills are hidden
     - The page URL changes to include `?category=saved`

5. **Test on mobile**
   - Resize your browser window to mobile size (narrow), OR
   - Open the site on your phone
   - Tap the filter icon (usually three horizontal lines or a funnel)
   - **You should see**: The "Saved Skills" button is there on mobile too

6. **Remove the filter**
   - Click "Filter & Discover" again
   - Click "All Skills" or any other category
   - **You should see**: All skills are visible again, not just your saved ones

7. **Unsave a skill**
   - Go to any saved skill's detail page
   - Click the filled bookmark icon
   - **You should see**: The bookmark becomes an outline (unfilled)
   - Go back to the homepage
   - Click "Filter & Discover" ‚Üí "Saved Skills"
   - **You should see**: The count decreased by 1, and that skill is no longer in the list

### üìù Technical Details (for reference)

  - `lib/filters.ts` (added 'saved' category handling in `applyFilters`)
  - `components/FilterMenu.tsx` (added "Saved Skills" button to desktop, mobile subpanel, and mobile inline views)

- New dependencies: None
- Configuration changes: None

   - **For this Next.js app**:
     - Open your terminal (Command+Space, type "terminal", press Enter)
     - Type: `cd /Users/stacyenot/Projects/skilltree/skill-web`
     - Type: `npm run dev`
