## Feature: Complete SEO and Google Search Indexing Setup

### üéØ What Was Built

Your website is now fully optimized for Google search and ready to be discovered by users worldwide. Here's what was implemented:

- **Google Search Console Integration**: Your site can now be verified with Google Search Console using the verification code embedded in the website. Google will recognize your site as legitimate and start indexing your pages.

- **Sitemap for Search Engines**: Created an automatic sitemap that tells Google about all 17+ skill pages on your site. This helps Google discover and index every page efficiently.

- **Search Engine Instructions (robots.txt)**: Added a file that tells search engines like Google what they're allowed to crawl on your site (answer: everything!).

- **Rich Social Media Previews**: When someone shares your site on Twitter, LinkedIn, or Facebook, it will now show a beautiful preview card with your title, description, and image.

- **SEO Meta Tags**: Every page now has proper titles, descriptions, and keywords that help Google understand what your content is about and show it in relevant searches.

- **Structured Data**: Added special code (JSON-LD) that helps Google create rich search results with breadcrumbs, article information, and more.
