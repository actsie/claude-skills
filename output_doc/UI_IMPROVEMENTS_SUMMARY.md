## Feature: Card Layout Alignment Fixes

### ðŸŽ¯ What Was Built

Fixed alignment issues where skill card descriptions didn't line up evenly when card titles wrapped to different numbers of lines (2 vs 3 lines). The cards now have consistent spacing and better visual hierarchy.

- **Smaller title text**: Changed card titles from large text to medium size so they take up less vertical space
- **Proper spacing**: Added consistent spacing between title, description, categories, and tags
- **Fixed container structure**: Moved all card elements inside the proper flex container so they align correctly
- **Featured badge position**: Kept the featured badge in the top-right corner with proper spacing

### ðŸ§ª How to Test This Feature

**Follow these exact steps:**

1. **Open the Application**
   - Navigate to http://localhost:3001 in your web browser
   - You should see: A grid of skill cards on the homepage

2. **Look at the Card Grid**
   - Find cards with different title lengths (like "Excel & Spreadsheet Manipulation" vs "Code Review Assistant")
   - **You should see**: The description text below each title starts at the same vertical position across all cards in a row
   - The featured badge (star icon with "Featured") appears in the top-right corner of some cards

3. **Verify Card Content**
   - Check that the categories (colored pills) appear below the description
   - Check that all tags are visible (no "+X more" indicator)
   - **Expected result**: All content is inside the card border with proper spacing

## Feature: 3-Column Grid Layout with Wider Cards

### ðŸŽ¯ What Was Built

Changed the skill card grid from a 4-column layout to a 3-column layout with wider cards for better readability.

- **Maximum 3 columns**: Cards now display 3 per row on large screens instead of 4
- **Wider container**: Increased the page width from 1280px to 1400px
- **Responsive layout**: Still shows 1 column on mobile, 2 on tablet, 3 on desktop

### ðŸ§ª How to Test This Feature

**Follow these exact steps:**

1. **View on Desktop**
   - Open the site in a full-width browser window
   - **You should see**: Exactly 3 cards per row
   - Cards should be wider than before, giving more space for content

2. **Resize Your Browser**
   - Make the window narrower (tablet size)
   - **You should see**: 2 cards per row
   - Make it even narrower (phone size)
   - **You should see**: 1 card per column (stacked vertically)

3. **Check Card Spacing**
   - Look at the gap between cards
   - **Expected result**: Even spacing between all cards in all layouts

## Feature: Dark, Readable Text in Skill Overview

### ðŸŽ¯ What Was Built

Fixed the skill detail page overview text that was too light and hard to read. All body text, headings, and list items now use darker colors for better contrast.

- **Darker body text**: Changed from gray-700 to gray-900 (nearly black) in light mode
- **Darker dark mode text**: Changed from gray-300 to gray-100 (nearly white) in dark mode
- **Applies to all content**: Paragraphs, lists, headings, and bold text all have improved contrast

### ðŸ§ª How to Test This Feature

**Follow these exact steps:**

1. **Navigate to a Skill Detail Page**
   - Click on any skill card from the homepage
   - **You should see**: The page loads with the breadcrumb at the top (not scrolled down)

2. **Read the Overview Tab**
   - Make sure the "Overview" tab is selected (should have a light purple/blue background)
   - Look at the text in the main content area
   - **You should see**: All text is dark and easy to read (not light gray)

3. **Test Dark Mode (if applicable)**
   - Switch your system to dark mode or use the browser's dark mode toggle
   - **Expected result**: Text appears in near-white color, clearly visible against the dark background

## Feature: Pill-Style Navigation Tabs

### ðŸŽ¯ What Was Built

Redesigned the "Overview" and "About" tabs on skill detail pages from underline style to modern pill/button style without a bottom border.

- **Removed bottom border**: The horizontal line under tabs is gone
- **Pill-shaped tabs**: Tabs now have rounded corners and background colors
- **Active state**: Selected tab has a colored background instead of an underline
- **Hover effects**: Tabs show a subtle background color when you hover over them

### ðŸ§ª How to Test This Feature

**Follow these exact steps:**

1. **Go to Any Skill Detail Page**
   - Click on a skill card to open its detail page
   - Look at the "Overview" and "About" buttons below the skill title

2. **Check Tab Appearance**
   - **You should see**: Two rounded buttons/pills with no line underneath them
   - The active tab (Overview by default) has a light purple/blue background
   - The inactive tab (About) has no background

3. **Click Between Tabs**
   - Click "About" to switch tabs
   - **Expected result**: The "About" button gets the colored background, "Overview" loses it
   - Click back to "Overview"
   - **Expected result**: The active tab styling switches back

## Feature: Auto-Scroll to Top on Page Load

### ðŸŽ¯ What Was Built

When you click a skill card and navigate to its detail page, the page automatically scrolls to the top so you can see the breadcrumb navigation and skill title.

- **Scroll reset**: Page position resets to the top when loading a new skill
- **Consistent experience**: Every skill detail page starts at the same scroll position

### ðŸ§ª How to Test This Feature

**Follow these exact steps:**

1. **Scroll Down on Homepage**
   - On the homepage, scroll down so you're viewing cards in the middle or bottom of the page

2. **Click on a Skill Card**
   - Click any skill card to navigate to its detail page
   - **You should see**: The page loads with the scroll position at the very top
   - The breadcrumb ("Skills > Category > Skill Name") is fully visible at the top

3. **Return and Test Again**
   - Click the "Skills" link in the breadcrumb to go back to the homepage
   - Scroll to a different position
   - Click a different skill card
   - **Expected result**: Again, the page loads scrolled to the top

## Feature: Improved Author Section with Links

### ðŸŽ¯ What Was Built

Enhanced the author section in the sidebar with properly centered content and added placeholder social links (GitHub and Website).

3. **Check the Links**
   - Below the author name/bio, look for a line separator
   - Below the line, you should see two links:
     - "GitHub" with a GitHub icon
     - "Website" with a globe icon

4. **Test Link Interaction**
   - Hover your mouse over each link
